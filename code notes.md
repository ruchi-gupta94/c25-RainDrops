Steps for creating Rain Drops :

Step 1: Create a class drop.js from writing the features of drops.

Step 2: we have the following properties: x,y which are at random positions, 
the, add a function draw, update to display my rectangles on the screen.
Add extra 20 to y position, as i am making 3 rectangles continuous to follow a rain effect.
also, dont forget to call one function inside another. So that we can create a repition.  repeated draw and update inside each other

Now, call the class drop.js to create a repeated loop for each raindrop. and make the display for them.

The output should look like:
